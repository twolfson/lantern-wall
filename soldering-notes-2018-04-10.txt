Tried out soldering with new lead-free solder as well as playing around with temperature

750F + lead-free solder

Melts well, can easily see when it's back to reformed (shiny -> matte)
Still burning board easily
Solder sticking to iron a lot

Moved to 450F

Solder not melting at all
Board not burning either though

Moved to 550F

Need to heat up the solder a little but getting a lot of control
Able to cool sculpt the solder with the iron

Moved to 500F

Not melting not like 450F

Moved to 600F

Solder melts quicker
Starts to brown board a little if I linger, nothing substantial though

Moved back to 550F for remainder

This seems good
Although cool sculpting isn't preferred; solder might not be mechanically sound if we don't let it fully melt according to Adafruit
Still was able to draw a square nicely =3

Definitely not going back to 750F any time soon

Going to play with solder sucker and jumpers now

Now reading through https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation

They say 750F for lead-free... ;_;

I guess I better try to get better...

Okay, results are in

It was sloppier but it's probably the right way to solder

Need to learn to not linger on joint

Need to learn to learn to wait for solder to cool before joining for a long run

The gloss/matte effect really really helps

It allows me to verify that the solder is melting properly

As well as how much of it is melting to know when I'm overmelting a part of a run

Oh, and I'm aware of cleaning the tip more often

Also started using a respirator mask but the internet seems to say it's doing nothing for chemical fumes...

-----------

Did 1 more run with a 3x3 square

Did it perfectly with 0 charring on other side of board

I think I'd ready =D

I should prob practice with wires and desoldering now too though

Oh well, it's 1AM. I'll do it another day

**Remaining tasks:**

[x] Figure out if this perfboard's contacts are difficult
  Nope, it was my skill level and solder
[ip] Try making lots and lots of tests via spare wire + solder
  Perfboard, wire, and solder are cheap
  http://www.instructables.com/id/Soldering-102%3a-Soldering-a-jumper/
[x] Figure out how to not burn board... I'm guessing it's be precise and fast. Don't linger
  Yep, don't linger ;) Also a good solder helps
[x] Round corners of cut out items via Dremel or sandpaper -- Did this last time, it worked great
[ ] Figure out better light diffusing strategy (could be raise LED via hot glue (still 1 sided), place 2 LEDs on opposite side of board (need more power))
[n] Play around with wire wrap and joining to jumper wires to "IC" connections
  I think we'll be fine
