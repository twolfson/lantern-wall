We're realizing that CR2032 aren't particularly rechargable so to avoid going through them like candy, we'd like to verify that the battery life is good in practice

Starting with a fresh CR2032. Voltage reading is 3.3V. Amperage is 7.5mA

Estimate based on 240mAh will be: 32 hours (240/7.5)

Prob going to pause/play a bunch to avoid missing end

Times:

- 2018-04-23 8:11PM to 1:39AM (5h 28m)
    -  9:50PM, still going strong
    - 10:45PM: still going. 2.87V, 3.6mA -> 67 hours
        - Prob having some brightness loss but can't tell because it's subtle and over time
    - 12:49AM: still going. 2.87V, 3.45mA
    -  1:39AM: still going. 2.87V, 3.47mA
- 2018-04-24 6:34PM to 2:01AM (7h 27m)
    -  6:34PM, 2.85V, 4.45mA (straaange)
    -  8:27PM, 2.80V, 3.30mA
    - 10:00PM, 2.79V, 3.08mA
    - 11:52PM, 2.80V, 3.23mA
    -  2:01AM, 2.76V, 2.84mA

SparkFun has been informative that batteries often start a few fractions of a volt about their nominal voltage (e.g. 4.3V for 3.7V nominal lithium polymer, 1.5V for 1.2V nominal AA/AAA)

Learning that CR2032 has nominal discharge of 0.2mA

Based on the lower right graph, it looks like we're running into a limitation caused by battery itself

Could pulse at 6.8mA but there's prob an issue with non-pulse

It's not the battery's discharge limiting us. It's the LED limiting the current due to the battery's voltage

https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/diode/diode12.gif

As the voltage to an LED increases, its current increases

Each LED color has different ideal voltages but 3.0-3.2V is normal for the ones we're using

Unfortunately CR2032 is dipping under 3.0V for our usage =/

We'd probably be better off with 3.7V batteries but I think CR2032 might be good enough for the project as is

We aren't looking to always maximize lighting and this avoid risks of fires

And definitely lasts for at least 12 hours (probably 60 based on existing guesses)

Going to go ahead and wire up remaining circuits. We can always hack them later and they're low cost
