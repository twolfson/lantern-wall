We're realizing that CR2032 aren't particularly rechargable so to avoid going through them like candy, we'd like to verify that the battery life is good in practice

Starting with a fresh CR2032. Voltage reading is 3.3V. Amperage is 7.5mA

Estimate based on 240mAh will be: 32 hours (240/7.5)

Prob going to pause/play a bunch to avoid missing end
