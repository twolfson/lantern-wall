We're realizing that CR2032 aren't particularly rechargable so to avoid going through them like candy, we'd like to verify that the battery life is good in practice

Starting with a fresh CR2032. Voltage reading is 3.3V. Amperage is 7.5mA

Estimate based on 240mAh will be: 32 hours (240/7.5)

Prob going to pause/play a bunch to avoid missing end

Times:

- 2018-04-23 8:11PM to 1:39AM
    -  9:50PM, still going strong
    - 10:45PM: still going. 2.87V, 3.6mA -> 67 hours
        - Prob having some brightness loss but can't tell because it's subtle and over time
    - 12:49AM: still going. 2.87V, 3.45mA
    -  1:39AM: still going. 2.87V, 3.47mA

SparkFun has been informative that batteries often start a few fractions of a volt about their nominal voltage (e.g. 4.3V for 3.7V nominal lithium polymer, 1.5V for 1.2V nominal AA/AAA)

Learning that CR2032 has nominal discharge of 0.2mA

Based on the lower right graph, it looks like we're running into a limitation caused by battery itself

Could pulse at 6.8mA but there's prob an issue with non-pulse
