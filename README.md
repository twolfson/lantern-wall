Documentation for a glowing lantern wall

## Summary
While decorating my apartment, I decided to leverage a picture rail and attempted to make a wall of [Cloud Clouds][]

[Cloud Clouds]: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/led-cloud-connected-cloud

During the process, I realized that cloud clouds would look too bulky for what I wanted as well as require a lot more thought to power/illumination

Now the result is one-off perf-boards with a CR2032 battery, LED, switch, and weak resistor
