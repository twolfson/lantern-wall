We've got our new resistors in and now know that a CR2032 is 3.3V nomially so we should figure out how to maximize our amperage and see how it affects brightness

White LED:
  Forward voltage: 3V-3.2V
  Max amperage: 20mA

I think we can choose anywhere in range so let's go with high end

Total voltage = LED voltage + resistor voltage
White LED:
  3.3V = 3.2V + V_r
  V_r = 0.1V

V=IR
White LED reisistor:
  0.1V = 0.02A*R
  R = 5ohms
  Closest we can get is 10ohms
  This makes current:
  0.1V/10ohm = I
  I = 0.01A (10mA)

  Previously for 220ohm:
  I = 0.0005A (0.5mA)
  Reading this from a multimeter: 2.58mA so calculation might be off somehow...
  V = 2.58mA*220ohm = 0.57V
  Weird, the multimeter voltage is correct too:
  2.6V to LED, 0.6V to resistor

  Going to play it safe and multiply the actual amperage to 20mA:
  20mA/2.6mA = ~7.7x
  220ohm/~7.7x = 28.6ohm
  Next closest: 47ohm

  47ohm result. Definitely brighter
  Oddly voltage changed:
  2.86V to LED, 0.42V to resistor
  8.4mA (measured)

  Let's go up to 20ohm...
  Even brighter!
  2.98V to LED, 0.3V to resistor
  15.0mA (measured)

  Adafruit says we can go up to 30mA? o_o
    https://learn.adafruit.com/all-about-leds/forward-voltage-and-kvl
  Prob going to say 20ohms is fine. Might try it out though for education >_> <_<

  10ohm resistor
  20.6mA (measured)
  3.07V to LED, 0.21V to resistor

Why are resistors at 10, 22, 47 variants?
  It's logarithms. Thanks logarithms

It looks like it's normal for LEDs to vary voltage draw based on current
  Also varies with temperature
  https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/173477

Also, I've been reminded to verify the resistor can handle the power dispersion
White LED resistor:
  P = VI
  P = 0.21V * 20.6mA
  P = 0.0043W (4.4mW)
  also
  P = V^2/R
  P = 0.21V^2 / ~10ohm
  P = 0.0043W (4.4mW)

Went back to measurements and verified resistor is true, damn variable LEDs =/

Resistor ohms (V=IR; R=V/I): 20.0ohms
Resistor ohms (V=IR; R=V/I): 10.2ohms

Second board completed

First laid out components, once again optimizing for vertical narrow layout

Then soldered them in place

I was much more confident this time

Unfortunately, the LED and resistor weren't secured properly so they were off the board when I was done

I loosened solder with heat and repositioned, broke pads, but eventually got them

Clipped leads

Then I beaded out would-be leads including double-checking LED polarity

Then I soldered everything together

Unfortunately, I accidentally soldered the switches leads

There has to be a system to know when to not solder tight component leads to itself =/

Maybe sharpie or coloring it

Also had to lay board level due to solder being affected by gravity

Got it much cleaner this time than v1

Now waiting for board to cool before using CR2032 socket. We don't want to over-harden its metal again

Verified its continuous though

Plugged it in, looks great!

Sharpied where to cut to prevent overcutting top/bottom

Cut out with scissors

Sanded edges/corners with P50, P100, and P180 sandpaper

Looks great. Trying it out now

It fits and works! It's even smaller than the last one

It's so bright the LED is visible within the smallest lantern ._.

There is a weird light pattern going on, I really want even LED lighting

Maybe we can run wires instead and make it suspended in the center of the bulb somehow?

A few ideas:

- A hard support structure for the LED (e.g. tape/shrinkwrap)
   - Would be difficult to insert into lanterns, maybe there's a smaller alternative
   - Could do a wire but it's not guaranteed
- Wire/clip in board at top of lantern and suspend LED down
   - Possible but clipping in is prob easier said than done
- Same board but LED is on a fixed-length wire
   - Would make colors specific to lanterns
   - Could make them headers
   - Still have voltage restriction
   - We might have this problem no matter what due to brightness of larger lanterns

Yea, let's proof of concept that last one...
   It would be much easier with a quarter bread board

Also need to verify brightness works for large/small (i.e. 1 LED still good in large, maybe 2 LEDs + batteries

Verified that 1 LED and current size board prob won't be enough for large lantern

Let's build out the sizes 1-3 lanterns though

Strategy 1:
- Use (string + cut) or (tape measure) to find ideal length of wire
- Affix LED to wire, prob via electric tape (don't have any F to F headers
- Breadboard it and get overhang version working
- Solder LED to proper length wire
- Wire up a board, solder it, use it

Maybe wait for a second...
Use breadboard again to find ideal placement

It looked like at being just at the bottom of the lantern was fine...

Also, definitely need to upsize board for size 3 but LED is fine

Took a break for food

Thought of a couple new strategies:

- Simply tape the LED and coin cell together, then tape on string and hang it. No board needed
- If we go with a circuit board, we should mount the wire on the other side of the board so it's easier to access the switch from the bottom instead of through
- Improvement on top of that: create a board with a wire soldered into it (or string) for it to hang from
    - Add traces for LED. Add LED hanging off of board

```
  ( + )   // Wire connecting to lantern hook
 (  !  )  // Wire
(   |   ) // Circuit board
 (  *  )  // LED off of circuit board
  (   )
```

Strategy for that new one:
- Evaluate height of current board variant, verify it's short enough for smallest lantern
- Run string through perfboard, verify it can be hung

Another strategy:

- Free-hand circuit with everything wired with no board (heavily inspired by SparkFun's video about it)

Tried out putting a wire in an existing board to hang it. It works :+1:

Now trying standalone breadboard again

LED lighting feels off, have to be an extreme end of lantern to get diffusion. Want to explore diffuser caps

Going to try out a 400 grit sandpaper hack... read about one in an earlier post and Instructables agrees
  http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to-defuse-an-LED/

Wow, that solved it so well. No more cut off problem. It's gone =D

Now to build another board with this diffused LED

Set up board with elevated LED this time too

Also clipped 1 of the switch's edge leads as we don't need both and it complicates things

Trick for short terminal CR2032 holder, used pliers to turn out pins

Soldered everything nicely then realized that logistically battery holder was backwards =(

Solder suckered it out successfully

Beaded again, soldered lines again

Definitely gave self harder situations

Getting much better though, keeping things flat helps a lot

Done, continuity looks good. Switch works when we want it to

Have a bit of popped solder, going to reheat it

Done, looks good

We keep on burning flux on tip of soldering iron. I think it's normal but annoying to clean, tip, solder, clean, etc

Waiting for circuit to cool before trying it out

Added battery, looks great

Sharpie, cutting, sanding edges, trying out in lantern

It works fucking amazingly. Fuck yessss

Okay, now we have to build lighting for all our lanterns

Going to call it for tonight

...

It keps on going for a bit more

I started exploring color schemes as I might need lead time to buying new LED colors

I took previous mocks for dye and altered it

I also created an array of LEDs on a breadboard to see current color options

Settled on decent white/blue/green mix for now

...

Did one more task for the night after trying to figure out proof of concept for colors

I set up alligator clip test for 2 white LEDs in series on largest lantern to see if we'd want/need more batteries/battery holders. I'm torn to be honest but it's better to be safe than sorry (time lags suck) so I'm getting 10 more of each

**Next steps:**

- [n] Buy a smaller breadboard for easier prototyping. Maybe even a tri-pad stripboard with headers
    - This might have been more of an impulse thought. Deferring for now
- [ ] Figure out lighting requirements for larger lanterns (using diffused LEDs)
- [ ] Figure out how to upsize boards for sizes 3-5 lanterns
- [x] Figure out desired color scheme
- [ ] Proof of concept colors with 10 breadboards and possibly F to F jumper-pinned wires
    - We could build out + solder boards but arguably this is cheaper
    - Maybe there's a middleground with header pins so we can swap out bulbs easily. Also acts as a nice standoff. Just not for smaller cases
    - Was about 55 tie point breadboards but realizing we can use alligator clips instead which I have a looot of :muscle: (thanks Makey Makey)
    - We only have 10 clips and it takes 3 but honestly, we can prob tape them
    - I'm getting too tired to keep on diving into this. Deferring for another night
- [x] Look into solder splatter
    - Caused by using flux boiling/too much flux 
        - https://stainedglassexpress.com/blog/2012/04/why-does-solder-bubble-and-splatter-when-soldering/
    - Also can be quality of solder. Try a different one
        - https://forum.allaboutcircuits.com/threads/reducing-solder-splatter.101820/
    - Apparently avoid "no-clean" due to cleaning annoyances
    - Going to go with Kester, seeing its name in Google search

        - https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/186069/what-does-no-clean-solder-actually-mean
    - Going with Kester Solder 83-7068-1402 as its the only Kester lead-free in small sizes that Amazon has
        - It's got a "48" resin activated rosin core which should be good
