We've got our new resistors in and now know that a CR2032 is 3.3V nomially so we should figure out how to maximize our amperage and see how it affects brightness

White LED:
  Forward voltage: 3V-3.2V
  Max amperage: 20mA

I think we can choose anywhere in range so let's go with high end

Total voltage = LED voltage + resistor voltage
White LED:
  3.3V = 3.2V + V_r
  V_r = 0.1V

V=IR
White LED reisistor:
  0.1V = 0.02A*R
  R = 5ohms
  Closest we can get is 10ohms
  This makes current:
  0.1V/10ohm = I
  I = 0.01A (10mA)

  Previously for 220ohm:
  I = 0.0005A (0.5mA)
  Reading this from a multimeter: 2.58mA so calculation might be off somehow...
  V = 2.58mA*220ohm = 0.57V
  Weird, the multimeter voltage is correct too:
  2.6V to LED, 0.6V to resistor

  Going to play it safe and multiply the actual amperage to 20mA:
  20mA/2.6mA = ~7.7x
  220ohm/~7.7x = 28.6ohm
  Next closest: 47ohm

  47ohm result. Definitely brighter
  Oddly voltage changed:
  2.86V to LED, 0.42V to resistor
  8.4mA (measured)

  Let's go up to 20ohm...
  Even brighter!
  2.98V to LED, 0.3V to resistor
  15.0mA (measured)

  Adafruit says we can go up to 30mA? o_o

  Prob going to say 20ohms is fine. Might try it out though for education >_> <_<

  10ohm resistor
  20.6mA (measured)
  3.07V to LED, 0.21V to resistor

Why are resistors at 10, 22, 47 variants?
  It's logarithms. Thanks logarithms

It looks like it's normal for LEDs to vary voltage draw based on current
  Also varies with temperature

Also, I've been reminded to verify the resistor can handle the power dispersion
White LED resistor:
  P = VI
  P = 0.21V * 20.6mA
  P = 0.0043W (4.4mW)
  also
  P = V^2/R
  P = 0.21V^2 / ~10ohm
  P = 0.0043W (4.4mW)

Went back to measurements and verified resistor is true, damn variable LEDs =/

Resistor ohms (V=IR; R=V/I): 20.0ohms
Resistor ohms (V=IR; R=V/I): 10.2ohms

Second board completed

First laid out components, once again optimizing for vertical narrow layout

Then soldered them in place

I was much more confident this time

Unfortunately, the LED and resistor weren't secured properly so they were off the board when I was done

I loosened solder with heat and repositioned, broke pads, but eventually got them

Clipped leads

Then I beaded out would-be leads including double-checking LED polarity

Then I soldered everything together

Unfortunately, I accidentally soldered the switches leads

There has to be a system to know when to not solder tight component leads to itself =/

Maybe sharpie or coloring it

Also had to lay board level due to solder being affected by gravity

Got it much cleaner this time than v1

Now waiting for board to cool before using CR2032 socket. We don't want to over-harden its metal again

Verified its continuous though

Plugged it in, looks great!

Sharpied where to cut to prevent overcutting top/bottom

Cut out with scissors

Sanded edges/corners with P50, P100, and P180 sandpaper

Looks great. Trying it out now

It fits and works! It's even smaller than the last one

It's so bright the LED is visible within the smallest lantern ._.

There is a weird light pattern going on, I really want even LED lighting

Maybe we can run wires instead and make it suspended in the center of the bulb somehow?

A few ideas:

- A hard support structure for the LED (e.g. tape/shrinkwrap)
   - Would be difficult to insert into lanterns, maybe there's a smaller alternative
   - Could do a wire but it's not guaranteed
- Wire/clip in board at top of lantern and suspend LED down
   - Possible but clipping in is prob easier said than done
- Same board but LED is on a fixed-length wire
   - Would make colors specific to lanterns
   - Could make them headers
   - Still have voltage restriction
   - We might have this problem no matter what due to brightness of larger lanterns

Yea, let's proof of concept that last one...
   It would be much easier with a quarter bread board

Also need to verify brightness works for large/small (i.e. 1 LED still good in large, maybe 2 LEDs + batteries

Verified that 1 LED and current size board prob won't be enough for large lantern

Let's build out the sizes 1-3 lanterns though

Strategy 1:
- Use (string + cut) or (tape measure) to find ideal length of wire
- Affix LED to wire, prob via electric tape (don't have any F to F headers
- Breadboard it and get overhang version working
- Solder LED to proper length wire
- Wire up a board, solder it, use it

Maybe wait for a second...
Use breadboard again to find ideal placement

It looked like at being just at the bottom of the lantern was fine...

Also, definitely need to upsize board for size 3 but LED is fine

Took a break for food

Thought of a couple new strategies:

- Simply tape the LED and coin cell together, then tape on string and hang it. No board needed
- If we go with a circuit board, we should mount the wire on the other side of the board so it's easier to access the switch from the bottom instead of through
- Improvement on top of that: create a board with a wire soldered into it (or string) for it to hang from
    - Add traces for LED. Add LED hanging off of board

```
  ( + )   // Wire connecting to lantern hook
 (  !  )  // Wire
(   |   ) // Circuit board
 (  *  )  // LED off of circuit board
  (   )
```

Strategy for that new one:
- Evaluate height of current board variant, verify it's short enough for smallest lantern
- Run string through perfboard, verify it can be hung
