Going to solder using wires this time. Haven't yet bought a window screen (meant to today) so going to avoid opening a window until later. Hopefully reduced solder usage is good enough

- Blue LED
- Was able to lay out with only using IC leads
- Looks good, a little hard to force down resistor leads with iron but good
    - Prob easier to do with hand then solder
    - Still getting splatter from solder =/
- Much faster too
- Trying out
- Good
- Cut, sand, resolder battery as it feels loose, sand more, good, neeeext!

- Anothe blue LED
- 12:16AM
- Prepping ICs
- Discovered the CR2032 has a little missing plastic so it can easily drop its gate. So clever yet secret
- Broke first battery holder terminal ._.
- Done placing at 12:26AM
- Started soldering, had a bit of a hiccup with leads conflicting with each other and over soldering, good now
- Done soldering at 12:33AM
- Lol, nvm -- missed positive terminal
- Fixed, now done at 12:36AM
- Have to wait for it to cool so going to start on another one in parallel

Testing/clipping CR2032 holders and switches
6 clipped, 6+6 tested, and good!

- Board is cooled, battery in, looks good
- Cut, skipping sanding for now (can do in bulk too)

- 12:44AM
- White LED
- Placed, clipped eagerly, soldered, looks great!
- 12:53AM
- Cool enough, drop gate, load battery, works!
- Cut it up
- 12:56AM
- Wow, so fast -- 12 minutes as opposed to 20 or 30

- Blue LED
- 12:57AM
- Wow, new record or something
- 1:04AM, done
- Waiting for it to cool
- Soldered in a new CR2032 battery holder for next one
- Blue is good
- Cutting now
- Done, good. 1:09AM

- Green LED
- 1:09AM
- Soldered, same as last one
- Battery in and good
- 1:16AM
- Cut again, no sand

- 1 thin board with space for 2 circuits
- Soldered both CR2032 holders on eagerly due to leveling/vice issues earlier
- 1:25AM
- Double setup up and soldered both circuits
- Was nice for simultanoues cooling of leads
- 1:39AM finish
- Cut again, no sand

- 1:43AM
- Last one board, white LED
- Solder in CR2032 holder, so much easier than pliers
- Fuck, a lead clipping went under a keyboard key =(
    - Prob need to pop-out keyboard to fix it
- Finished soldering
- Battery in, good!
- 1:52AM
- Cut out

- Sand all our 7 boards
- 2:14AM
- Done
- Done with everything

- All boards light up
- Going to try placement another day since it's now quite late
- Really happy with progress though
