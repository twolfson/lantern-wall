After getting through the initial portion of the battery testing, we've decided to continue building out the boards

Not much new things to note so going to bullet it out:

- Built blue board looking at diffused white
- Battery is accessible
- LED polarity is correct
- Soldered it up
- Verified connectivity
- Waiting for it to cool
- Added battery, missed a spot. Fixing
- Reverified connnectivity
    - It's neat how we can do connectivity for all one-way binding due to LED's diode nature (it's in the name, yey)
- Cooled, battery, good
- Mark, cut, sand, disco

- Same for a white LED
- Keep in burning flux due to staying/revisiting pad too often before letting it cool
- Connectivity good
- Cooling taking too long, cut now
- Sand
- Battery, good
- Disco

Taking approximately 20-30 minutes per circuit

- Green LED to round it out
- Same layout again
- 1:29AM
- Almost improperly rotated battery holder. Phew
- If the pad is smoking after you're done, it's likely due to overheated flux
- Soldering complete, lots of burned flux =(
- 1:47AM
- Maybe should start using wires instead of solder runs...
- Connectivity good
- Cut, sand
- Battery
- Looks good
- 1:55AM

New solder still leaving lots of little splatter everywhere

It might be me or the iron or the temperature...

Also need to open window, noticable smell despite using fume exhaustor and respirator

Calling it for the night

**Next time:**

- Open a window
- Use less solder by using wires
