# Dimensions
Smallest ball opening:
  Half-circle: 39mm x 19mm
  AAA: 10.25mm depth, 10.25mm width, tall height
    Would need 2
  CR2032: 1.2mm depth, 28mm width

Solution 1:
  AAAx2 + holder (uncertain if it would even fit...
  Run wire to LED blob and attach once inside
  Making them separate allows easier entry

Solution 2:
  CR2032 + perfboard + LED on board
  Need LED sizings. Prob small enough though

Tried out LEDs (photos on phone)

5mm clear ones should work fine

5mm clear white is bright. Might want 2x which means 2x power but we'll get to that later
5mm red and other shaded colors are pretty weak. Will prob want clear LEDs for maximum lumens

# Electricity
Got our battery holders, LEDs, and switches today

Trying out LEDs

Re-learning what we need for electronics to work

Arduino supply: 3.3V or 5V
LED voltage: 2-2.2V or 3-3.2V (depending on color)
Maximum amperage for LED: 20mA

Amperage is dynamic and will impact LED brightness directly

Must have secondary voltage drop though to take excess as LED can only take so much

3.3V source + 3-3.2V LED + 220ohm resistor

3.3V - 3.2V = 0.1V remaining

V=IR
V/R = I
0.1V/220ohm = ~0.5mA

For 2-2.2V:

1.1V remaining
1.1V/220ohm = 5mA

Amperage also directly affects how long battery life is:

CR2032 http://data.energizer.com/pdfs/cr2032.pdf

If we were able to drop at 2.0V (not really), then it'd be:

240mAh (milliamp hours)
  240mAh/5mA = 48 hours
  240mAh/20mA = 12 hours
  Still good for our purposes in both scenarios

But based on their graph, we'd lose at 600 hours for 0.2mA

which is 120mAh
  120mAh/5mA = 24 hours
  120mAh/20mA = 6 hours
  Still good for our purposes in both scenarios
  Pushing it a little with 20mA

Going to try building a board with a 220ohm resistor and then ordering more parts based on result

Doing a comparison between brightness of those LEDs
