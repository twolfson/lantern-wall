Smallest ball opening:
  Half-circle: 39mm x 19mm
  AAA: 10.25mm depth, 10.25mm width, tall height
    Would need 2
  CR2032: 1.2mm depth, 28mm width

Solution 1:
  AAAx2 + holder (uncertain if it would even fit...
  Run wire to LED blob and attach once inside
  Making them separate allows easier entry

Solution 2:
  CR2032 + perfboard + LED on board
  Need LED sizings. Prob small enough though

Tried out LEDs (photos on phone)

5mm clear ones should work fine

5mm clear white is bright. Might want 2x which means 2x power but we'll get to that later
5mm red and other shaded colors are pretty weak. Will prob want clear LEDs for maximum lumens
