I replaced the solder to see if we could reduce the splatter. Here are my notes

Feels similar

Still does the reflective when hot, matte when cool which is great

Beaded them just fine

Going to try joining runs now

It wsa non-trivial once again but got it done

I'm not seeing the specs of solder stick to the iron tip when I'm done cleaning which is a good sign

I think that was probably the best indicator
