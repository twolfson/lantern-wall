Struggled today and tonight to figure out what to get in a respirator

Our fume extractor is only activated charcoal

So it would stand to reason that our respirator only needs the same

This is done via an "organic vapor" cartridge/filter and does have a limited shelf life

So that's what I'm getting; a half-mask respirator and organic vapor cartridges

I was waffling on getting heavier duty ones but I think it's good

Ironically the "multi-gas" variant which covers everything is cheapest so I'm getting it

I'm also going to upgrade to a quick latch respirator because I know I'll take it on/off a lot when I'm reading/taking a break

Btw, it's impossible to figure out mask sizing. Comments are semi-helpful but not 100%. Going to get a large and hope it's good
