# Lanterns
Wall art for our apartment

This was initially inspired by SparkFun's Cloud Cloud video but after purchasing the lanterns, LEDS, and cotton. We felt insecure about the LEDs for heat and powering issues

We've decided to defer on cotton to make them clouds for now. So here are the results as of 2017/10/14

We've also tossed around the idea of dying the clouds (e.g. dark purple, green, orange, blue). Likely psychadelic but with sunset tones

## Action log
Bought lanterns for LED filling + cloudifying
Decided to start with basics via hanging + no clouds

Sketched out placement options

Put up with long lengths of string

Used tape to adjust lengths without cutting

Measure lengths with tape adjustments

Take down each 1 by 1 and cut string to measured length

## Notes
Taped heights:
Length of string from hook to fixture. Excludes width of wire and fixture
  Wire - Unnoticable. Fixture - 0.625
Lanterns from left to right. 9 total.

  5 sizes. 2x of each but removed 1 due to hitting door
39.625. Smallest -> never modified. Guess 40.25

18.25. 2nd smallest -> never modified. Guess 18.875
32.75. 2nd largest -> never modified. Guess 33.325
19.5. Largest -> 21.125
29.125. 3rd (medium) -> 29.75
34.25. 2nd smallest -> 34.625 after cuts
21.25. 3rd (medium) -> 22 after cuts
26. Maybe -.25 due to middle wire attachment. 1st largest -> 26 after cuts
10. Smallest -> 10 after cuts
