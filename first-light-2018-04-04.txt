Tonight we finished our first light

Component placement worked well. That was prob the only thing that worked well

We couldn't easily solder long runs

We couldn't easily reference exactly 1 hole

Solder kept on coming off of original joint

We don't know ideal temperature and kept on burning board

Eventually we got everything placed/soldered

Then the connected the battery

It lit up!

Unfortunately, the battery clip was really shitty so it broke almost immediately (maybe overheated it causing hardening?)

Then we soldered that back on and taped it

It worked!

And it fits in the lantern!

Although it's hard to turn on/off, maybe put the switch on the outside

Also the light doesn't diffuse great

**Tasks for next time:**

[ip] Buy new solder
[ip] Buy rosin flux
[n] Figure out how to clean soldering tip. Maybe buy a higher precision tip
  It's likely oxidized causing poor heat conductivity
  Actually, it's fine =_=
  It's shiny where it counts

Figure out if this perfboard's contacts are difficult
[ip] Buy magnifying glass goggles
Try making lots and lots of tests via spare wire + solder
  Perfboard, wire, and solder are cheap

Figure out how to not burn board... I'm guessing it's be precise and fast. Don't linger
[n] Buy desired components: Better battery holders, maybe duals for multiple LEDs
  Skipped for now, want to figure out my shitty soldering first
Round corners of cut out items via Dremel or sandpaper
Figure out better diffusing strategy (could be raise LEd via hot glue (still 1 sided), place 2 LEDs on opposite side of board (need more power))
Play around with wire wrap and joining to jumper wires to "IC" connections
