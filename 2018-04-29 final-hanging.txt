Finally hanging up the boards

Deferred due to life

Put in the boards

Cut out some carboard for boards that needed padding

Electric taped onto cardboard for all of them

Did this for the 2 LED lanterns as well

Looks good although it's daylight so can't tell

Took out boards and applied white duct tape to cover up bottoms of board from when looking into lantern

Looks pretty good, could be better with constant lighting for all lanterns but that's muuuch more effort

Will take a photo at night at some point
