Exploring color proof of concept

Initial attempt:

- Take a CR2032
- Put it in a holder
- Wrap resistor around 1 pole and tape it
- Wrap LED around other pole and tape it
- Connect remaining ends and tape them together

Doesn't work very well. Components too loose

Second attempt:

Make a throwie minus the magnet

- Take a CR2032
- Put LED on both its ends
- Tape it
- Done

Good, just don't hold it for too long due to no resistor

Could also inline a resistor for the LED but don't really want to

-----------------------

Okay, back and deciding to still use a resistor. It was bugging out with the LED a little earlier

Going to also diffuse all LEDs for this experiment

- [2 of 5] White LEDs (3 singles, 1 double)
- [0 of 4] Blue  LEDs (2 singles, 1 double)
- [0 of 2] Green LEDs (2 singles)
