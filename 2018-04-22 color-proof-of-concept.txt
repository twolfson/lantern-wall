Exploring color proof of concept

Initial attempt:

- Take a CR2032
- Put it in a holder
- Wrap resistor around 1 pole and tape it
- Wrap LED around other pole and tape it
- Connect remaining ends and tape them together

Doesn't work very well. Components too loose

Second attempt:

Make a throwie minus the magnet

- Take a CR2032
- Put LED on both its ends
- Tape it
- Done

Good, just don't hold it for too long due to no resistor

Could also inline a resistor for the LED but don't really want to

-----------------------

Okay, back and deciding to still use a resistor. It was bugging out with the LED a little earlier

Going to also diffuse all LEDs for this experiment

- [5 of 5] White LEDs (3 singles, 1 double)
- [0 of 4] Blue  LEDs (2 singles, 1 double)
- [0 of 2] Green LEDs (2 singles)

After some more trial/error, layout attempt that works best is to make both LED and resistor linear/tightly packed battery then wrap their ends

This minimizes the leads slipping from the tape

```
// Off/disconnected
      & // LED
     * *
 ****   ***
+++++
-----
 ****   ****
     ~~~  // Resistor


// On/connected
      & // LED
     * *
 ****   *
+++++    ** // Twisted wires
-----    ***
 ****   *
     ~~~  // Resistor
```

It also helps to do an L bend on the battery side so they resist flipping
