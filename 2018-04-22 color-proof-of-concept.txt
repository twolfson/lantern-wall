Exploring color proof of concept

Initial attempt:

- Take a CR2032
- Put it in a holder
- Wrap resistor around 1 pole and tape it
- Wrap LED around other pole and tape it
- Connect remaining ends and tape them together

Doesn't work very well. Components too loose

Second attempt:

Make a throwie minus the magnet

- Take a CR2032
- Put LED on both its ends
- Tape it
- Done

Good, just don't hold it for too long due to no resistor

Could also inline a resistor for the LED but don't really want to

-----------------------

Okay, back and deciding to still use a resistor. It was bugging out with the LED a little earlier

Going to also diffuse all LEDs for this experiment

- [5 of 5] White LEDs (3 singles, 1 double)
- [4 of 4] Blue  LEDs (2 singles, 1 double)
- [2 of 2] Green LEDs (2 singles)

After some more trial/error, layout attempt that works best is to make both LED and resistor linear/tightly packed battery then wrap their ends

This minimizes the leads slipping from the tape

```
// Off/disconnected
      & // LED
     * *
 ****   ***
+++++
-----
 ****   ****
     ~~~  // Resistor


// On/connected
      & // LED
     * *
 ****   *
+++++    ** // Twisted wires
-----    ***
 ****   *
     ~~~  // Resistor
```

It also helps to do an L bend on the battery side so they resist flipping

Ammeter checks:

- Green LED: 10mA with 10 ohm resistor
- White LED: 8mA with 10 ohm resistor
- Blue LED: 8mA with 10 ohm resistor

I'm going to bet they'll be a little more in a breadboard, no idea in circuit since we'd need to break the circuit (e.g. pluggable wires)

Since we had 20mA on breadboard previously

All done and wired up

The board LED is definitely brighter than the taped LED

Connected all of the LEDs

It turns out I miscounted and needed to use a non-diffused LED

Everything looks good

The brightnesses do vary a lot but I think that's alright

It's art, it doesn't have to be perfect/consistent

The proper fix for this would be to swap our the resistors with potentiometers and tune the resistance appropriately

Correction to my previous claim about being unable to test circuit board with an ammeter. It's possible if we turn off the switch and short-circuit around it with the ammeter

Anyway, going to move forward with 10 ohm boards for each LED

And add 1 more white LED to the list

The pattern goes from left to right

- Size 1. 1 white LED
- Size 2. 1 green LED
- Size 4. 2 white LEDs
- Size 5. 2 blue  LEDs
- Size 3. 1 white LED
- Size 2. 1 blue  LED
- Size 3. 1 blue  LED
- Size 5. 2 white LEDs
- Size 1. 1 green LED

Totals:

- White LEDs: 2 singles, 2 doubles (4) (6 total)
- Green LEDs: 2 singles, 0 doubles (0) (2 total)
- Blue  LEDs: 2 singles, 1 double  (2) (4 total)

Plan once we've created all our boards:

- For larger lanterns, take some cardboard and place boards on that. Tape them down for easy in/out

For proof of concept, we used blue painter's tape (we were out of electrical) to seal up holes to toss in proof of concepts

Fun fact: The proof of concepts were bright enough to illuminate the room with main lights off =3

Getting late, calling it for the night

Tested out the ammeter with the circuit. The theory works though somehow it's only 5mA. Maybe the battery died enough over time. Yea, it's already down to 2.8V
